What
====

Pyrex is a simple shell script to drive DVD ripping. It is just a wrapper
around; mplayer, mencoder, ffmpeg, ffmpeg2theora, oggenc and mkvmerge.


Use
===

$ ./pyrex.sh will display the following simple help message:

Usage: pyrex.sh -t <title no> -a <audio id> -c <channels> 
		-r <aspect ratio> [-P profile] -o <output name>

Aspect ratio is in the format 16:9 or 4:3

Profile can be one of; mpeg4, theora+ac3, theora+vorbis or webm
It defaults to; theora+ac3


title no	- The title number on the DVD you want to rip.
audio id	- The audio id of the title you want to rip, can be got from
		  mplayer. Often 128 but not always.
channels	- The number of channels in the above audio track. Generally
		  either, 6 for 5.1 audio or 2 for stereo.
aspect ratio	- 16:9 for widescreen or 4:3 for square.
profile		- Set the output profile. The current options are:

	mpeg4		- MPEG4 video + AC3 audio in an AVI container
	theora+ac3	- Theora video + 5.1 AC3 in a Matroska conatiner
	theora+vorbis	- Theora video + 2.1 vorbis in an Ogg container
	webm		- WebM

		  If you don't specify a profile, theora+ac3 will be used.
output name	- The name of the file you wish to generate. Don't use spaces
		  and don't specify a file extension, this will be added
		  automatically.

An example usage would look like:

$ pyrex.sh -t 4 -a 128 -c 2 -r 4:3 -P theora+vorbis -o 03-Diefenbakers_Day_Off


Problems
========

Sometimes ffmpeg2theora gets the duration wrong for the VOB. You can fix this
by running it through ffmpeg first. e.g

    $ ffmpeg -i DVD.vob -map 0.0 -map 0.1 -vcodec copy -acodec copy DVD.1.vob

Adjust the audio mapping (0.1 above) as required.

That seems to get rid of something at the start of file which contains some
duff information/data.
